# Images Json Portal

Images Json Portal is a Web Api tool for images. As a hosting service you can freely upload your images and photos and it produces the API. After that you can use the API to show in your client. You can use them to create a gallery or a slider component for example.

Like [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) you can find free pics on line but this app can expose in Json format a list of images of your choice and select what attributes you like to use.

The project is slowing proceeding and at the moment the images are stored in local directory.
