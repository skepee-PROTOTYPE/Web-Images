# Web Images

Web Images is a Web Api for image hosting service. It is like flickr (https://www.flickr.com/) where you can find free pics on line.
Web images exposes your list of images with a list of attributes in Json format.

The project is in early stage where the images are read for now from a local directory.

The exposed image attributes are:

* Title
* Length in KB
* Length in MB
* Url

The Json resource can be used in different clients. A slider, a gallery or an app.
